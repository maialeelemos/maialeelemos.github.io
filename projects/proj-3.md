Enjoy some short animations I made!

I created this first animation to practice my keyframing and transition skills on Adobe After Effects.

For this animation, I randomly picked a song from one of my latest playlists and used the audio to inspre my animation. In the end, it became a fun music video! I use a diverse number of effects by hand and using expressions. I also use a technique of frame by frame drawing called rotoscoping near the end of the animation as well.

This animation was inspired by a haiku written by Sonia Sanchez.
Your death <br>
A blues, I could not <br>
Drink away <br>
