title: 'Animation Basics Course Projects'

Starting off, this is my final project for the course. We were assigned to create an animation based off the prompt 'talent show'. So I decided to create an animation of a little octopus in a top hat showing off his talent of blowing bubbles.

This animation was created using Procreate to develop the character and Maya to sculpt and animate the sequence.

The next two animations are animation industry standards. The first is an animation of two balls bouncing. The purpose of this animation is for a beginning animator to learn about timing and speed. One of the balls in a tennis ball. The other is a bowling ball. These two are different sizes and made of different materials, so the way both of these balls bounce will be different. We needed to reflect this in our animation, so I animated the balls at different speeds and with different bounce
heights.

The second animation is the flour sack animation. This is a standard exercise an animation student will create because it helps the student practice weight, timing, expression, and exaggeration. Since a flour sack does not have facial expressions, animators need to use body language to express the feelings and intentions of the flour sack.

I created both of these animations using Clip Studio Paint.
