## Antique Fan
Materials: grpahite pencils (2B, 4B, 6B), ruler, Strathmore paper
Size of Work: 18x24 inches

This is a graphite still life drawing that took me 17 hours to complete. I sought to improve my shading and textures by using varying techniques of hatching, crosshatching, stippling, and blending to achieve a more realistic look. 

## Amaryllis, Daffodil, and Gardenia
Materials: Van Goph watercolors, brushes, hot-pressed paper, Faber-Castell colored pencils, Pigma micron liner
Size of Work: 9x12 inches

Gardenia, Daffodil, and Amaryllis is a series of portraits of strong women. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by combining multiple mediums in one piece (colored pencil, watercolor, and ink).

I find most of my inspiration from life. I take photos of places with aesthetic colors for future palettes or of interesting scenes I want to draw later on. I also enjoy sitting outside and creating quick sketches of the scenery or people around me. However, with this series of work, I wanted to further investigate people, and in particular, portraiture.

I sketched these three women because I was drawn to the emotion and power they emanated. I created a series of portraits that contrasted these strong women to the delicate flowers in the foreground. In earlier society, all women were depicted as dainty, fragile, and delicate people. However, through many movements, especially over social media, women have become stronger and more confident than ever. I wanted to create a portrait that captured both of these sides.

Gardenias mean trust and hope. They also are a way to say, “you’re lovely.” Daffodils represent inspiration, creativity, and new beginnings, while amaryllises represent determination and beauty. I paired each woman with a particular flower in my portraits. I am interested in how the meaning of the flowers are reflected in the women and hope the viewer can discover their own connection to the work.
