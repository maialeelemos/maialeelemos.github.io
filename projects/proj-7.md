In my Narrative Basics course, we learned about the concept of co-creation, which is the process of creating a product or service where input from consumers plays the most important role. 

For this project, we worked with Maria Ivanova, the Director of the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University. She gave us a presentation about global environmental policies, describing when they were implemented, what they protected, and how well each country in the UN is implementing the policies.

For our project, we had to create a product about anything we were interested in from Ivanova's presentation for consumers of our choice. This was a project done in teams of five members. 

My team decided to design a website where users can read and submit political comics about the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (or CITES). Our goal was to educate the general public about the CITES environmental policy in an entertaining and digestable way. The below one-pager describes more of how we hope the audience will interact with our project.

To illustrate our project idea, we created an interactive prototype using Figma.

Our website is split into five different sections - Home page, Comics, About CITES, About Us, and Get Involved. The most important part of the website lies in the Comics page where our satirical comics about CITES are located. The below image depicts the wireframes making up the prototype and below that is an example of one of our comics.
