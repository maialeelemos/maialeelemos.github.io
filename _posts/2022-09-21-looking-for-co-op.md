title: "Looking for Northeastern Co-op Opportunity (Spring 2023)"
---

Starting this Fall of 2022 I am searching for a co-op/internship opportunity for the Spring semester (January to June 2023). I am looking for a computer science or combined computer science and art job that is full time (at least 35+ hours a week).

If you are interested in contacting me, please [email me](mailto:lemos.m@northeastern.edu)!

Thank you for reading!
