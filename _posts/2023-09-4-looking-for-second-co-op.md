title: "Looking for Northeastern Co-op Opportunity (Spring 2024)"
---

This past Spring I had the wonderful opportunity of working aat Viken Detection for six months where I developed software for their homeland security products. From this co-op I now have experience in android development, app/mobile development, UX/UI design, and working in a professional setting and project teams. It was an incredible learning experience that I will always be remember.

Now, I am searching for another co-op for Spring of 2024 (January to June 2024). I am looking for a job in the computer science industry that is a full time position (at least 35+ hours a week).

If you are interested in contacting me, please [email me](mailto:lemos.m@northeastern.edu)!

Thank you for reading!
